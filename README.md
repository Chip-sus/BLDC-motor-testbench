# BLDC motor testbench with stm32 development board

## Description

This project serves as a template for controlling a BLDC motor, with detailed instructions to operate the system and can be used on any course related to STM32 microcontrollers.
This project initially aimed for educational purposes of encourageing junior students to pick up a follow-up project with BLDC and/or develop more features from the base project.
The testbench will enable students to explore the operation, control, and performance characteristics of BLDC motors with available resources of an average laboratory.

## Used Resources

### Hardware:

- DF45M024053-A2 BLDC Motor, produced by Nanotec Electronic GmbH & Co. KG
- STM32 Nucleo L152RE Development board (other boards in STM32 family should work the same with modification based on the reference manual)
- X-NUCLEO-IHM07M1 Three-phase brushless DC motor driver expansion board
- MSOX2012A Mixed Signal Oscilloscope with 2 Analog Plus 8 Digital Channels
- Fluke 179 Multimeter
- PS3010L Adjustable DC Power Supply
- Some other basic equipment and electrical components were utilized to ensure the quality of the progress.

### Software:
- Atollic TrueSTUDIO for STM32
- C Embedded Project template within TrueSTUDIO IDE
- RealTerm Serial terminal
